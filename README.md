Ricky's Drawing on the Web Final Project

<!-- 
For my final project, I am going to create a series of visual representations of the three most common mechanical keyboard keyswitch variants: clicky, tactile, and linear. 
	At their core, keyswitches are a simple mechanical means of completing a circuit. Despite their function being a simple one, each switch variant possesses some nuance and personality. My hope is to visually convey that core utilitarian simplicity while preserving the character of each switch. 
I’d like to capture that same utilitarian theme throughout the entire user experience. The goal is to create a cohesive, fluid user interface, which means employing a single html page to house the menu and each keyswitch’s individual pages. To execute this, I’m planning on using a series of HTML canvases displayed via a carousel interface.
The plan is to have no, or very little, text on the entire page. That means not necessarily labeling each page. It’s not so important that the user identifies each switch by their actual designation, what’s important is that each switch’s page conveys that variants unique qualities. The simplest visual distinction between the variants will be how they’re color coded. With that said, users shouldn’t need to know that the blue switch is clicky or that the red switch is linear. Blue switches are loud, abrupt, almost jarring. Reds are smooth, silent, muted. Tactile switches have a similar physical sensory experience to clicky switches, aren’t quite as “clacky”.
How each switch sounds is extremely important to their identity, so as each switch’s canvas is brought into focus, their particular typing sounds will start playing. 
Media elements:
	Visual
		Landing page SVG graphic
		Graphics for each of the 3 primary pages
		Drawn from raster graphics of either actual switches or their respective diagrams using canvas draw.
		Color coded (red, green, blue is a good place to start)
		Background image
			Likely solid fill, possibly some minimal SVG elements for texture
			Alternatively, vector image of keyboard plate or PCB
		Forward/back buttons
		SVG graphics
			Keycap legends
			Something more fun than just next/back
			Incorporating the full primary/secondary legends for either media keys or something along the lines of the [+ =] and [-_] keys.
	Audio
		Background music
		Ambient, looping, non-offensive, Badbadnotgood feels
		3 typing sounds samples
		Vintage Model M buckling springs! Tangerines! Box jades/navys!
		Will overlap with background music. When the page loads, background music begins. When you navigate to a switch page, audio track #2 starts. Navigating to another switch will stop the previous page’s typing sounds and start the new one.
